# üìä Amazon Prime Video - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üß† Project Summary

This project explores and analyzes the Amazon Prime Video catalog to uncover trends in content diversity, regional availability, popularity, and user ratings. By performing structured EDA on a merged dataset of title metadata and credits, we aim to understand what types of content dominate the platform, how it's distributed globally, and what factors influence user engagement.

## üéØ Business Objective

- Identify dominant genres and categories to understand content diversity.
- Analyze regional content distribution to find growth opportunities.
- Study content evolution over time.
- Examine correlations between popularity and rating metrics.
- Help stakeholders optimize content acquisition and recommendation systems.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset is a combination of two files:
- `titles.csv`: Metadata like title, release year, genres, rating, etc.
- `credits.csv`: Cast and crew information.

**Merged Dataset:** ~125,000 rows, 19 columns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning & Manipulations

- **Removed Duplicates** in `credits` data based on `(id, person_id, role, character)`
- **Handled Missing Values**:
  - Filled missing descriptions, certifications
  - Imputed seasons (for movies = 1)
  - Dropped rows with critical missing ratings (where needed)
- **Type Conversions**:
  - Categorical: `type`, `genres`, `production_countries`
  - Numeric: Casted and cleaned `seasons`, `votes`, etc.
- **Outlier Treatment**:
  - IQR method used for `runtime`, `imdb_score`, etc.
  - Log transformation for highly skewed fields like `imdb_votes`, `tmdb_popularity`
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted `release_decade`
  - Exploded `genres` and `production_countries` for grouping
  - Created visual summaries using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

## üìà Key Insights

- **Genres like Drama, Comedy, and Action** are most common on Prime.
- **US, UK, and India** dominate content production.
- **TV shows have grown** significantly post-2015 in both volume and ratings.
- **IMDb ratings are moderately correlated** with TMDB popularity, but runtime doesn't impact ratings much.
- **Content with higher TMDB popularity and IMDb scores** tends to have more votes and engagement.
